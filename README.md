# Python_Toolbox
Multi-purpose tools for a variety of projects

The functions/classes in this file are intended to have specific uses, yet be as versatile as possible.

Simple tools that are 3 lines of code, can be just as valuable as a tool that is 100+.

**This file was never intended to be ran by itself. It is intended to provide functions/classes or ideas that can be used in production programs. Do not attempt to run this directly. ** 

** If you are a coder who designs his ideas in an interpreter such as ipython then this is probably for you **
